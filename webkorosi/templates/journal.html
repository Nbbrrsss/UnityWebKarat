          <p>Natural plant extracts show excellent performance in inhibiting steel corrosion.

          <p>This paper proposes a quantitative structureâ€“property relationship model (QSPR) based on machine learning 
            (ML) for a pyrimidine-pyrazole hybrid as a corrosion inhibitor. Based on the metric values of the coefficient of

            found to be the best predictive model for the N-heterocyclic dataset and its respective non-aggregated dataset. 
            When the XGBoost model was applied to three additional pyrimidine-pyrazole hybrid derivatives, this consistency was also seen, and high corrosion inhibition efficiency (CIE) values were obtained ranging from 82.09% to 
            95.26%. According to the CIE trends found from the ML predictions, DFT calculations for these derivatives also

            Abstract. Corrosion is a major concern for the industrial and academic sectors because it causes 
            significant losses in many fields. Currently, there is a great deal of interest in the topic of material 
            damage control using organic chemicals. Pyridine and quinoline are potential corrosion 
            inhibitors because they are non-toxic, inexpensive, and efficient in various corrosive conditions. 
            Experimental  studies  in  searching for  candidate  corrosion  inhibitor  candidates require  a  lot of 
            time, cost, and labor intensive. Using a machine learning (ML) strategy based on a quantitative 
            structure-property relationship (QSPR) model, we evaluate gradient boosting regressor (GBR), 
            support vector regression (SVR), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms as predictive models 
            to  investigate  corrosion  inhibition  efficiency  (CIE)  of  pyridine-quinoline  compounds  in  this 
            study. We found that the GBR model, when compared with the SVR and KNN models as well 
            as models from the literature for the pyridine-quinoline compound dataset, has the best predictive 
            performance based on the metric coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square ... <a href="{% url 'view_pdf' '2023 - JPCS' %}" target="_blank" >Read More</a></p>

          <p>This study proposes a novel approach that combines machine learning (ML) and density functional theory (DFT) 
            methods to construct a quantitative structure-properties relationship (QSPR) model for diazine derivatives as

            represent diazine compounds. Thirty-two different ML algorithms were implemented on the dataset, and the 
            gradient boosting regressor (GBR) model was identified as the best predictive model for diazine and each isomer 
            dataset based on the coefficient of determination (R2
            ) and root mean square error (RMSE) metric values. This 
            consistency was also observed when the GBR model was implemented on four other diazine derivatives, resulting 
            in high corrosion inhibition efficiency (CIE) values ranging from 85.02 % to 94.99 %. The DFT calculations for

          <p>Corrosion is an electrochemical process between the metal 
            surface  and  a  corrosive  environment  that  can  lead  to  significant 
            losses  in  various  industries,  especially  in  the  oil  and  gas  sector. 
            Experimental studies are conducted to evaluate the performance 
            of corrosion inhibitors and available resources. In this research, a 
            machine  learning  (ML)  approach  is  employed  to  assess  the 
            effectiveness of expired drug compounds as corrosion inhibitors. 
            The primary challenge in machine learning is obtaining a highly 
            accurate  model  to  ensure  that  predictions  are  relevant  to  the 
            properties  of  the  tested  materials.  Therefore,  the  polynomial 
            function is tested in the gradient-boosting regressor (GBR) 
            algorithm to  enhance the  accuracy  of  the developed  ML  model. 
            The  results  indicate  that  the  implementation  of  the  polynomial 
            function in  the  GBR  algorithm can  improve  the accuracy  of  the
